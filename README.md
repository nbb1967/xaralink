# xaralink
Preview in default browser for BMP/GIF/JPEG/PNG export. Module for Xara graphics software.


The original preview module from Xara has been deprecated 10 years ago and is still trying to run Internet Explorer in 2023. This module was made to replace it and opens the preview of graphics export in your default browser. To distinguish the modules, the color of the new module icon has been changed to orange.


### Installation:
Replace the original xaralink.exe in the folder with the installed program.

> [!NOTE]
> To be fair, in 2025 this ancient bug is already fixed in "black & white" Xara, but I'll leave this module here for all the fans of "color" Xara...
